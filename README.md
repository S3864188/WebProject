Our team leader is Loi - the one who is confident in researching and learning new programming languages. And he is also the code checker, making Main Page and some others. Other members are coders and propose the code to Loi to check. We are also very interested in web programming so our assignment will be done as good as possible.

Comment:
For some reasons that this link is not work as we expect than offline folders/files. Specifically, using github link, in index.html we have put background images as product welcomed, but turn out it not appears, as well as user-account.html when it not want us to access. On the contrary, our whole pages work well when they run offline by download their zip file and run it in our computer. That's all we provide information to you about our website. In concluded, if you need our website working well, please contact to our group for the benefits of both side and avoid unnecessary misunderstandings in this assignment.
