                    <p>We will reimburse You no later than 14 days from the day on which We receive the returned Goods. We will use the same means of payment as You used for the Order, and You will not incur any fees for such reimbursement.</p>
                    <h1>Conditions for Returns</h1>
                    <p>In order for the Goods to be eligible for a return, please make sure that:</p>
                    <ul>
                    <li>The Goods were purchased in the last 30 days</li>
                    <li>The Goods are in the original packaging</li>
                    </ul>

                    <ul>
                    <li>The supply of Goods made to Your specifications or clearly personalized.</li>
                    <li>The supply of Goods which according to their nature are not suitable to be returned, deteriorate rapidly or where the date of expiry is over.</li>
                    <li>The supply of Goods which are not suitable for return due to health protection or hygiene reasons and were unsealed after delivery.</li>
                    <li>The supply of Goods which are, after delivery, according to their nature, inseparably mixed with other items.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>We reserve the right to refuse returns of any merchandise that does not meet the above return conditions in our sole discretion.</p>
                    <p>Only regular priced Goods may be refunded. Unfortunately, Goods on sale cannot be refunded. This exclusion may not apply to You if it is not permitted by applicable law.</p>
                    <h1>Returning Goods</h1>
                    <p>You are responsible for the cost and risk of returning the Goods to Us. You should send the Goods at the following address:</p>
                    <p>702 Nguyễn Văn Linh Street, Tân Hưng Ward, District 7, Hồ Chí Minh City 700000 Vietnam</p>
                    <p>We cannot be held responsible for Goods damaged or lost in return shipment. Therefore, We recommend an insured and trackable mail service. We are unable to issue a refund without actual receipt of the Goods or proof of received return delivery.</p>
                    <h1>Gifts</h1>
                    <p>If the Goods were marked as a gift when purchased and then shipped directly to you, You'll receive a gift credit for the value of your return. Once the returned product is received, a gift certificate will be mailed to You.</p>
                    <p>If the Goods weren't marked as a gift when purchased, or the gift giver had the Order shipped to themselves to give it to You later, We will send the refund to the gift giver.</p>
